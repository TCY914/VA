<h1 id="overview">1. Overview</h1>
<p>In this take-home exercise, we reveal Ohio’s economy and look more in
details on its business prosperity by creating interactive data
visualizations with <code>ggplot2</code> and its extension packages in
R. The data is provided and can be downloaded from <a
href="https://vast-challenge.github.io/2022/">VAST Challenge 2022</a>
and the topic is about the first point in challenge 3.</p>
<h1 id="data-preparation">2. Data Preparation</h1>
<h3 id="installing-packages">2.1 Installing Packages</h3>
<p>The following packages and libraries are installed for this exercise.
Important and relative packages for plotting an interactive graph in R
are:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>tidyverse</code> designs for data science and is used
extensively for data preparation and wrangling.</li>
<li><code>ggiraph</code> creates dynamic ggplot graphs with hover and
click actions.</li>
<li><code>DT</code> provides an R interface to the JavaScript library <a
href="https://datatables.net/">DataTables</a> that creates interactive
table on html page.</li>
<li><code>patchwork</code> combines multiple ggplot objects into a
single figure.</li>
<li><code>tooltip</code> a column of datasets are displayed when the
mouse is over responding elements.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="importing-the-dataset">2.2 Importing the Dataset</h3>
<p>To reveal Ohio’s financial health, we would only focus on their main
commercial businesses, but not including catering industry like
restaurants and Pubs. Therefore, the only dataset would be used in this
exercise is regard to Ohio residents’ Job information. There are 6
variables in this dataset, including their working hours, working days,
hourly rate and education requirement and so on.</p>

<p><strong><em>DERIVING A NEW COLUMN</em></strong></p>
<p>Here we would like to create a new column to view how many employees
are there in each company. By doing so, we use the <em>mutate()</em> of
<code>dplyr</code> to generate the frequency by employer_id.</p>

<p><strong><em>RENAMING THE COLUMN</em></strong></p>
<p>The default name of using <em>count</em> to derive the above new

like to change the column name and call it No.Employees.</p>

<p><strong><em>REMOVING USELESS COLUMNS</em></strong></p>

later. To keep the data more clean, we remove some useless columns by

<p><strong><em>CONVERTING DATA TYPE</em></strong></p>

the category to classify the raw data, we need to convert the data type
from numeric to categorical.</p>

Distribution of Numbers of Companies on Numbers of Employees</h3>
<p>Generally, numbers of employees can be regarded as a company’s
productivity. Thus, to identify which business is more popular and
appears to be more prosperous in Ohio, we would first take a look at
their employees number. Since there are over 500 of businesses in our
dataset, we use numbers of employees as our category to be the x-axis
and display which enterprises have hired the most and the least
workers.</p>
<p>To create an interactive graph, it is not enough to only use
<code>ggplot2</code> to make it. The bar chart of numbers of companies
on numbers of employees is plotted as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>highlight_key()</em> is part of <code>plotly</code> package,
which can help us create an object of class
<em>crosstalk::SharedData</em> to connect and show corresponding outputs
of two graphs or a graph with data table.</li>
<li><em>highlight()</em> is also a function of <code>plotly</code>
package. It can link to multiple plotly graphs and set various options
for brushing them.</li>
<li><em>bscols()</em> makes us easily to put HTML elements side by side.
In this graph, it is used for connecting the datatable with the bar
chart.</li>
</ul>
<p>Through the above function, when selecting each whole bar on the
graph, the below table would automatically show more details for the
corresponding row data.</p>

Distribution of Hourly Rate in Prosperous Businesses</h3>
<p>It is not enough to just look at the numbers of labours in a company
to display its prosperity. Here, we would like to see the distribution
of hourly rate by numbers of employees and further observe whether
larger scale of companies would pay more to their employees. The violin
graph is plotted by <em>ploy_ly()</em>, which is a function in
<code>plotly</code> and is more or less same as <em>ggplotly()</em> to
construct an interacitve graph.</p>

<p>The violin plot with boxplot can easily show the distribution of
hourly rate in each category and disclose some statistical information
from the dataset. The graph indicates:</p>
<ul>
<li>The range of hourly rate is high in company with 5 and 8 employees,
with maximum hourly rate up to 100 and minimum around 10.</li>
<li>The majority of residents in Ohio earn around 10 to 20 dollars every
hour.</li>
<li>The interquartile range of each category are not obvious, meaning
that no matter the scale of businesses the wage of most people do not
have much difference.</li>
</ul>

Distribution of Hourly Rate by Education Requirement</h3>
<p>Ridge plot is a good visualization to display the distribution of
continuous value based on a categorical variable. The possible factor to
affect the hourly rate is education requirement. We would like to see
whether higher education level would be granted with more wage.</p>

<p>It can be observed that people who are graduate surely earn more
money than others. The density of hourly rate in graduate distribution
is around 20 to 30 dollars; however, others are around or below than 15
dollars. In addition, its range in 95% of probability distribution is
much wider than other, meaning that most people in this category have
higher wage.</p>

<p>There are some intereting findings in this interactive graph:</p>
<ul>
<li>The average hourly rate in graduate is higher than other education
level roles.</li>
<li>The differences of average hourly rate is small between people
graduating from high school or college and with low education
level.</li>
<li>The value of standard deviation in hourly rate for people with
higher education level would become greater, implying that the education
level is not the only way to decide a person’s wage.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="learing-points">4. Learing Points</h1>
<p>This take-home exercise helps us to hone our skills to design a good
visualization for other people to use. Furthermore, it also makes me
more understand the usage of different packages in R for plotting a
graph, especially ggplot2 with <code>ggirafe</code> and
<code>ggplotly</code>.</p>
<p>My key takeaways are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Adding interactivity is like a auxiliary tool for us to tell more
stories in a graph; however, it is not always a must. It is possible to
be an additional function for people to use or even bother them to read
from the visualization. Thus, we need to think about the purpose for our
visualization design.</p></li>
<li><p>There are many packages can help us build an interactive plot in
R, but some of them cannot use together and even would affect another
execution. We should always plan first before starting to write down the
code so that we can select the correct package to create what we
expect.</p></li>
